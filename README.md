A WIP(ish) roguelike _very_ loosely based of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup written in Java.

Special Thanks:

 * Edward, for creating the original BAZAKA.
 * Liam, for inspiring with us the fiery passion for programming (/sarcasm (/sarcasm)).
 * [Trystan](http://trystans.blogspot.com/), for an awesome [library](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel) and [tutorial](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2011/08/roguelike-tutorial-what-and-why.html).
